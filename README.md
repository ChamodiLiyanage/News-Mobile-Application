# News-Mobile-Application

This project was done for the academic purposes of the Mobile Application Development(MAD) module (Year 2 Semester 2 )at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology.

NewsApp is a dynamic mobile application developed using Kotlin, offering users a personalized and efficient way to stay informed. The app leverages the News API (newsapi.org) to fetch real-time news articles, which users can read and save for later. With an intuitive user interface, NewsApp provides a seamless news consumption experience, keeping users engaged and well-informed.
